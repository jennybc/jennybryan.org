Hello, I'm Jenny Bryan and I am part of [Hadley Wickham's](http://hadley.nz) team at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). We develop open source [R](http://www.r-project.org) packages to make data science faster, easier and more fun. If that sounds intriguing, [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org) is a great place to learn more.
