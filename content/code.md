Most of my software work is done in the open, on GitHub. View my profile: [github.com/jennybc](https://github.com/jennybc)

I work on the team that maintains the packages in the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/) and [r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib) organizations.

Packages that I specifically maintain or contribute heavily to:

  * [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org)
  * [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org)
  * [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org), which is replacing [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets#readme)
  * [googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org)
  * [usethis](http://usethis.r-lib.org)
  * [gh](https://github.com/r-lib/gh#readme)
